# KISApp

Hello folks,

This is our attepmt at  an app for our school that engages the user in multiple scenarios such as looking up thier schdules and of thier friends too.
It will be topped up with a Announcements sections that gets updated and informs the user in real-time to keep in time with the updates from the school. But it doesn't stop there
even going so far as to integrate brithday reminders which is complemented with our calendar api that pulls data from our school website

This app extracts data from our schools login portal and is rendered to fit the screens of their phone with a custom developed UI using SwiftUI. 
So far the backend work seems to be complete with the only work remaining in coding up the UI and integrating it with MongoDB. This is a pretty simple app
with no groundbreaking features but helps the user by making their lives easier insted of haviing to pull out Safari and log into their portal and then wait
for what is countless minutes for their data to appear

Thank you for reading ðŸ˜ƒ <br>
